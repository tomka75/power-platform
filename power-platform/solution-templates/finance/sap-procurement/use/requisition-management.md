# SAP Requisition Management app

The SAP Requisition Management app allows you to do several functions in SAP quicker and easier than using SAPGui. You can view a requisition, search for a requisition, change an existing requisition, or create a new requisition.

## View requisition data

You have three options for viewing a requisition:

- Select a recent requisition that you have interacted with.
- Type in the requisition number, if you know it.
- Search for a requisition based on vendor and date range.

### Select a recent requisition

From the _Select recent requisition_ dropdown list, you can see a list of previous requisitions that you have interacted with. Choose one from the list and it will load the data for that requisition.

### Enter a requisition number

If you know the requisition number of the document you want to view, you can type it in the _Search requisition number_ field.

### Search for requisition

If you haven't interacted with the requisition, and you don't know the exact number, you can search for a requisition.

1. Select the **funnel icon** to open the requisition search screen. On the screen, you can search by any individual field or a combination of _Requisition Number_, _Vendor_, and _Date Range_.

   :::image type="content" source="media/requisition-management/req-search.png" alt-text="Image shows requisition search screen.":::

1. Enter your selection criteria in the fields.
1. Select **Search** and your results will be displayed.
1. Select the requisition you would like to see, and it will be displayed on the requisition overview screen.

## Create a requisition

You can create a new requisition:

1. Select **Create**.

1. Enter a vendor number.

1. Select the arrow pointing to the right side of the screen, next to the vendor number, and the vendor name appears.

1. Select the appropriate Purchasing Organization from the dropdown list.

1. Select the appropriate Purchasing Group from the dropdown list.

## Add a line item to a requisition

1. Select **+ Add** at the _Items_ level.

1. View the _New Requisition Item Details_ page.

1. Select your location (plant).

1. If you know your material number, enter it, or you can search by selecting the filter symbol.

1. If you select the **Search** filter, the material search page opens.

1. Search by _material number_, _description_, _material type_ or _location_ (_plant_). Select the **material number**. As an example, pick _PRODUCT2_ and it populates that data into the new requisition item detail screen.

1. Now enter the quantity and the unit price. The _Unit_ field was prepopulated when we selected this material from the _Material Search_.

1. View the total automatically calculated based on the quantity multiplied by the unit price.

1. Select **Done** to add this line item to the requisition.

### Add, cancel, or save the requisition

1. Select **+ Add** to add more line items.

1. Select **Cancel** if you don't want to keep the requisition and everything will be removed.

1. Select **Save** when you're finished. When you select **Save**, the requisition data is saved to SAP, and the SAP document number will appear in the upper left corner.

## Additional functionality

When you load an existing requisition, you have the ability to edit or convert to purchase order.

- If you select **Edit**, you're able to change values, add more line items, or delete unwanted line items. To delete an unwanted line item, select the **check box** on the left side of the line, and select **Delete** at the top. You can also copy an existing line by selecting it and selecting **Copy**.

- If you want to edit a line, select the **Edit** link at the right side of the line under _Details_.

### Additional items functionality

You can sort column headings by ascending or descending order. To sort, select **Column Heading**. An _arrow_ appears to show you the sort order.  

> [!NOTE]
> The sort is done as a character string, so numbers may not be in numeric order.

You can also filter items in the _Items_ list. The filter box can be found on the right side of the _Items_ list.
